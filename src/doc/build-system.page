h2. Build system

Inquisitor is supported with flexible build system that allows both
straightforward quick start and long-term development comfort.

For a quick start instructions, see
<a href="{relocatable:installation.page}">installation</a>.

h3. Basic build structure

Inquisitor's build system is based on simple system of directories and
Makefiles and should be portable to most build hosts.

Everything starts with a */Makefile* in root Inquisitor directory. This
Makefile contains most common build targets and defines general build
interface. It provides the most important target: *make all*. Ideally,
it's the only thing end-user would need.

However, most of the times, end-user would like to tweak some
configuration values. This can be done by editing */Makefile.config*, a
coarse configuration file with a few settings.

Most important of them are:

* *FLAVOUR* - flavour of Inquisitor to build. Changing this setting
dramatically changes the whole build process and the product you'll get
in the end. Currently, two flavours are supported:
** *live* - builds an ISO of Live CD/DVD system,
** *enterprise* - builds a full client/server system.
* *TARGET* - target architecture to build a client for (i586, x86_64).
* *CLIENT_BASE* - system to base a client image on.
* *DEPLOY_HOST* - server host to deploy client image to.
* *DEPLOY_PATH* - path on DEPLOY_HOST to client image that will be
exported using NFS.

h3. Summary of build targets

h4. End-user build targets

* *make all* - do everything, according to set configuration. In fact,
it executes step-by-step build targets in a right sequence.

h4. Step-by-step manual build targets

* *make build-package* - builds a package (rpm, dpkg or possibly
something else) with client from <b>client/</b> and configurations.
Resulting package usually goes to local repository (<b>repo/</b>) then,
to be used in further client root build process.
* *make build-root* - builds a client root image, based on a given
configuration.
* *make build-boot* - prepares infrastructure needed to boot, based on a
given flavour.
* *make build-live* - packages everything into an live CD/DVD ISO image.

h4. Developer build targets

* *make update-package* - replaces pre-built client package in a
pre-built client root image.
* *make update-package-remote* - replaces pre-built client package in a
pre-built client root image, deployed remotely on DEPLOY_HOST server.

h3. Client structure

All code that would be executed on a client resides in *client/*
directory. Client build subsystem mostly consists of simple recursive
Makefiles. There are 3 main targets, available in every directory:

* *make all* (default) - build everything;
* *make install* - install everything;
* *make clean* - clean up everything built.

Issuing a *make && sudo make install* in *client/* would build and
install the client right into build host.
