h2. Quick-start installation

This section gives quick hints to those who wants to build Inquisitor
from source. Note that you don't <em>have</em> to do it: you can
<a href="{relocatable:/download.html}">download and run a pre-built Live CD</a>.

For complete build system documentation, see
<a href="{relocatable:build-system.html}">build system</a>.

h3. Requirements

* A Linux system; the following software is required for a succesful
build:
** GNU make
** gcc v4 or later
** ruby v1.8.6 or later
** wget
** rpm or deb development set
* For <b>Live</b> and <b>Enterprise</b> - a properly configured access
to repositories that you want to build your distribution from; a local
mirror copy is preferred, as it would be much faster to install from.
* A system to test (it can be the same system).

h3. Configure

Untar Inquisitor source code. Edit @Makefile.config@ to choose:

* *FLAVOUR* - one of three <a href="{relocatable:flavours.html}">flavours</a>.
* *TARGET* - set your target architecture to build a client for (i586,
x86_64).
* *CLIENT_BASE* - which distribution would should we build client for
(if you're going to do a <b>Live</b> or <b>Enterprise</b> build, you'd
need properly configured access to repositories of this distribution,
otherwise, it just affects what you'll get as a resulting package).

h3. Build

Just run
<pre>make all</pre>

Note that if your build will require confirmation of proprietary
licenses (for hardware RAID controllers handling), you'll be asked to
enter your confirmation interactively.

h3. Result

* <b>Standalone</b> - you'll get an @*.rpm@ or @*.deb@ in Inquisitor directory.
* <b>Live</b> - @work/livecd.iso@.
* <b>Enterprise</b> - client root image in @work/chroot@ directory,
ready to be served from NFS server.

h3. Running

* <b>Standalone</b> - run @/usr/bin/inq-live@ for a nice text
UI or <a href="{relocatable:manual-invocation.html}">invoke individual tests manually</a>.
* <b>Live</b> - burn a resulting ISO on a CD and boot from it.
* <b>Enterprise</b> - running an enterprise version is more complex than
other flavours; please refer to <a href="{relocatable:server.html}">server deployment guide</a>
for more information.
