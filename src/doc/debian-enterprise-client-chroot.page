h2. Enterprise client chroot under Debian

h3. Packages needed for building

* subversion
* make
* debootstrap
* dpkg
* build-essential
* fakeroot
* debhelper
* ruby
* rsync
* unzip
* rpm

h3. What else do you need?

* root privileges

h3. Building

All following operations will go under inq/trunk directory.

* Edit Makefile.conf:
** Change FLAVOUR to enterprise
** Change CLIENT_BASE to debian
** Be sure to use another DEPLOY_PATH if there is already another enterprise version exists on a server.

* Edit build/debian/Makefile:
** Change REPO to your preferred Debian repository URL
** Change REPO_MULTIMEDIA to preferred debian-multimedia repository URL
** Change REPO_BRANCH to preferred Debian distribution branch (etch, lenny, unstable, etc)
** Change REPO_SECTIONS to preferred Debian reopsitories sections (main, contrib, non-free, etc)

* Create package:

<pre>
make build-package
</pre>

There is Einarc, that can ask you additional questions and maybe it can
cause more actions.

* If you need to place something to your chroot, then you can create
compressed tarballs with everything you need. They will be unpacked to
chroot (so preserve aboslute paths in them).

* Create chroot itself:

<pre>
make build-root
</pre>

It can take much time and questions from user. To prevent questioning,
you can add all answers in build/debian/preseed preseed file.

* Then you need to rsync chroot, and create some special devices on it.
You can see how it is working in rsync target in Makefile. You can
modify it according to your needs, as it is very varying for different
users. And then, at last, make rsync:

<pre>
make rsync
</pre>

* Configure diskless clients booting (PXE environment and NFS shares
exporting).

Example kernel command line maybe like this:

<pre>
append ip=dhcp root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=10.254.254.1:/inq/root-debian-x86_64 init=/usr/bin/inq-wrapper pci_noms
</pre>
